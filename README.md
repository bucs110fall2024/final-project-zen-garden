## Project Description

My project will be a simple game in which a player starts with a certain amount of money and bets against a dealer bot playing blackjack from a randomized deck. If the player wins, he will receive a reward equal to his bet, if he wins with a blackjack he will reveve a reward 1.5x of his bet, if he matches the dealers total he will get his bet back, and if he loses he will lose his bet.
